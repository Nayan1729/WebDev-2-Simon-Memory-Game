Start: Click anywhere on the device to start the game.

Sequence: Simon will play a sequence of colors by lighting up the buttons in a specific order. Pay close attention to the sequence because you'll need to repeat it.

Repeat the Sequence: After Simon has played the sequence, it's your turn to repeat it. Use your memory to press the buttons in the exact same order that Simon did. If you get it right, Simon will play a longer sequence in the next round.

Increasing Difficulty: As you progress through the game, the sequences will become longer and more complex. The challenge is to remember and repeat each sequence accurately.

Mistakes: If you make a mistake by pressing the wrong button or pressing them in the wrong order, the game will signal that you've failed that round. You can try again from the beginning or choose to start a new game.
